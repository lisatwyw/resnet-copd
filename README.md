This site is under construction.

We currently have posted the model weights of ResNets (Python3.6, Keras 2.2.0) that have been trained to detect spirometrically defined Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from a region of a chest computed tomography (CT) scan.

Details of the entire pipeline and validation experiments conducted on the datasets below will be posted.
1. [Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE)](http://eclipse-copd.com)
2. [Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer (PanCan)](https://www.tfri.ca/our-research/research-project/early-detection-of-lung-cancer---a-pan-canadian-study)
3. [COPDGene](http://www.copdgene.org/)

Additionally, we aim to post the following scripts in the near future:
- spatial normalization (via the ANTS image registration toolkit)
- lung mask generation (Python 3.6)
